# Story of "Dead Dog" “故事”

 The name "dead dog" comes from the great physics teacher Zhang. It is used to describe students who play in class. The PowerPoint file, which blacken the screen and make turning on computers easier, it is very similar to the description of "dead dog", so this PPT has called "dead dog" since that.
 
 “死狗”此名来自伟大的物理张老师，用以形容上课不认真的同学。将电脑黑屏，为了便于打开电脑的PPT与“死狗”所形容的很像，便称之为“死狗”。

**Q** Why do I blacken the screen?

**A** It's hard to be a computer manager at school. If you want to prepare for the exam and don't have time to turn off or turn on the computer and wait for it during such process(?), this dead dog will be what you need. Also, you can list it in the Windows Task Schedule. Then if you go to have dinner without turning off the computer, you won't care about it because the PC will automatically be blacken on time.

So Dead Dog is really a great thing at times. You can also enjoy its design style which comes from HUAWEI HarmonyOS. I might be the first one in the whole world who make PPT files in a design style of HarmonyOS!

That's aaaall. Even if you will say that What I've done is very strange because I made a PPT as if I made a programme, don't mind it. I just doing sth enjoyable from my point of view.
