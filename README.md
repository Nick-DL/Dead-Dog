# Dead-Dog Introduction 死狗（现名黑屏）简介
（下面英文介绍全是机翻）
"Dead Dog (死狗)"——A PowerPoint file which can blacken the screen

[Story of "Dead Dog"]

 The name "dead dog" comes from the great physics teacher Zhang. It is used to describe students who play in class. The PowerPoint file, which blacken the screen and make turning on computers easier, it is very similar to the description of "dead dog", so this PPT has called "dead dog" since that.
 
 “死狗”此名来自伟大的物理张老师，用以形容上课不认真的同学。将电脑黑屏，为了便于打开电脑的PPT与“死狗”所形容的很像，便称之为“死狗”。

Q Why do I blacken the screen?

A It's hard to be a computer manager at school. When you want to prepare for the exam and don't have time to spend lots of time to close, turn on the computer and wait for it to wait for power on, this dead dog will be what you need. Also, list it in the Task Schedule, then if you go to have dinner without turning off the computer, you also won't care about it because the PC will be blacken on time.

All in all, this is really a great thing. You can not only think about its creativity, but also enjoy its design style which comes from HUAWEI HarmonyOS. I thought that I might be the first one in the whole world who make PPT files in a design style of HarmonyOS!

That's allll.
