## Introduction
### Story of "Dead Dog" 

 The name "dead dog" comes from the great physics teacher Mr Zhang. It is used to describe students who play in class. The PowerPoint file, which blacken the screen and make turning on computers easier, is very similar to what "dead dog" describes. So this PPT has been called "dead dog" since that.

### Q & A

**Q** Why do I blacken the screen?

**A** It's hard to be a computer manager at school. If you want to prepare for the exam and don't have time to turn off or turn on the computer and wait for it during the process, this dead dog will be what you need. Also, you can list it in the Windows Task Schedule. Then if you go to have dinner without turning off the computer, you won't have tocare about it because the PC will automatically be blacken on time.

So Dead Dog is really a great thing at times. You can also enjoy its design style which comes from HUAWEI HarmonyOS. I might be the first one in the whole world who make PPT files in a design style of HarmonyOS!

That's aaaall. Even if you think what I've done is very strange because I made a PPT as if a programme, don't mind it. I just doing sth enjoyable from my point of view. 

## Future Planning

Ever since I entered senior high, Dead Dog has been of no use. Maybe in the future, I'll remake it with UWP, then it can be turned into a real application.
